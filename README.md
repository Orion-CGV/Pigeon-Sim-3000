# Legacy Arcade

## Game Brief
The player takes on the role of a child who inherits a collection of dusty, broken arcade machines from their late grandfather. While exploring, the child discovers a single pair of joysticks hidden in an old box. When plugging them into the arcade cabinet, the child is magically transported into the arcade games themselves. Each level transforms the player into a different character/avatar, corresponding to a unique game world.

The goal is to progress through these arcade-inspired worlds, completing objectives in each, and ultimately restoring the legacy of the grandfather's arcade.
